uSDLC Node Server
=================

The Node based server is a good light-weight server. By downloading one script for your operating system you can create a completely running server.

To install a production copy from the master branch without pulling a github copy download a link below and save the script. You will need `chmod +x` before you can run it.

For Linux or OS X:

`https://raw.github.com/uSDLC/uSDLC_Node_Server/master/release/uns-unix-install.sh`

For Windows:

`https://raw.github.com/uSDLC/uSDLC_Node_Server/master/release/uns-windows-install.exe`
 
Use `./go` or `go` to print a list of commands.

> The first time it is run after a github check-out it will install 3rd party libraries and systems.
